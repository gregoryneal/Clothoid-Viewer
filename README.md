# Clothoid-Viewer

A simple Unity project to view curves from my [ClothoidX](https://github.com/gregoryneal/ClothoidX) library. 

This comes with helper scripts to get started with how to display the points and build curves. 

The project comes with a compiled .dll of ClothoidX but there's no guarantee it works like the release versions from my repo.
