# Clothoid-Viewer
implementing solutions to some clothoid interpolation problems:

A clothoid is a curve whose curvature varies linearly with respect to its arc length. In this repository I explore generation, segmentation, and interpolation of clothoids using various methods by people way smarter than me. 

### Building clothoid segments given arc length, initial curvature and curvature derivative, or arc length and initial and final curvature:
